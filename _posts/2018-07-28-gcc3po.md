This robot was designed by myself and two other students to solve tasks on a changing course. The catch?Â  We could only use simple sensors, and we only had five weeks to design the robot in its entirety, build it and test it.

Not only was GCC-3PO a success, I consider it one of my favorite learning experiences to date.
