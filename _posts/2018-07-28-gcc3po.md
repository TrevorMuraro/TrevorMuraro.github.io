---

My team designed this robot to solve tasks on a changing course.  The catch?Â  We could only use simple sensors, and we only had five weeks to design the robot in its entirety, build it and test it.

I designed the overall layout of the robot, a seven-sensor tape sensor layout on the robot base that could be used to reliably determine the robot's precise location on the course, a three-sensor bumper arrangement to align with a very small ball delivery target, and the robot's ball delivery mechanisms and superstructure.  I also designed and wrote the majority of the software developed for the robot, including hardware drivers and multiple state machines.

Not only was GCC-3PO a success, I consider it one of my favorite learning experiences to date.
