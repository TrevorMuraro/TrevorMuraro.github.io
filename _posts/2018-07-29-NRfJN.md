When I interned at Vigilent in Oakland, I did development and QA for a project based on Node-RED.  When I started, I had no experience with JavaScript, Node.js or Node-RED - and at the time, Node-RED's test features weren't documented at all.


In addition to my development and QA work, I researched and compiled documentation on proper module development and testing for Node-RED for the other engineers.  After my internship, I decided to take everything I had learned about JavaScript, Node.js and Node-RED, and write the tutorial I'd like to have had when I started.  This is that tutorial.

Node-RED for Javascript Newcomers was written for Node-RED version 0.17, in December 2017.
