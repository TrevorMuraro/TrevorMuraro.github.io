Project AutoLot was a prototype parking management system designed and built by myself and two other students at UC Santa Cruz.  Our goal was to help deal with the campus' parking problems.

This sensor station is my work.  It is capable of monitoring a parking space while communicating with the cloud over secure Wi-Fi and drivers' phones over Bluetooth, and it can run for over a month on its rechargeable battery.

I designed, developed and tested the entire sensor station - physical construction, electronics and software - with the sole exceptions of the LED placement and enclosure lid.  The sensor station is built around a TI CC3220S microcontroller, which provides both control and Wi-Fi functionality.  Its main electronic components are mounted on a removable and replaceable "electronics plate" for ease of access and maintenance.  The entire system is designed for minimal power consumption, with every active component powered down when not in use.

Not only was my design successful, my detail-oriented approach to hardware and software design and testing enabled me to identify bugs that would otherwise have gone unnoticed.
