I and two other students at UC Santa Cruz designed this prototype parking management system to deal with the campus's parking problems.

This sensor station is my work.  It is capable of monitoring a parking space while communicating with the cloud over secure Wi-Fi and drivers' phones over Bluetooth, and it can run for over a month on its rechargeable battery.
